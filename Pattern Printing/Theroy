Java Hollow Pattern Collection
This is a collection of Java hollow patterns printed using nested loops and condition-based logic. It highlights my skill in writing neat, clean, and well-structured console output patterns â€” all for optimal readability.

What it Represents:
Solid understanding of looping constructs and conditional statements

Pattern logic using mathematical and spatial thinking

Clean, uncluttered code with descriptive method names

Modular design: each pattern in its own method

 Patterns Included:
Hollow Square

Hollow Triangle

Hollow Diamond

Hollow Pyramid

Diagonal + Border Patterns

Matrix Frame & Center Crosses

Ideal For:
Interview prep (patterns are typical coding questions)

Showing problem-solving & building logic skills

Java console-based project demonstration

 File: Patterns.java
Just compile and run! Modify the value of n to try out different pattern sizes.
