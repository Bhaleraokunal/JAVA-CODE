Increment Operator : "It is a unary operator" there are two types of this 
                      1) Pre-increment
                      2) Post-increment
                      
    1) Pre-increment: "If a variable is prefiexd with the '++' this then it is know as pre-increment."
                    Syntax :
                            "++variable"
                            
    2) Post-Increment : "If the variable is suffixed with the '++' this then it is know as a post-increment."
                    Syntax : 
                            "variable++"
                              
Derecment Operator : "it is also a binary operator which consist of two types."
                      1) Pre-decrement
                      2) Post-decrement

    1) Pre-decrement : "If a vriable is preffixed with this '--' then it is know as pre-decrement operator"
                    Syntax: 
                            "--variable"

    2) Post-decrement : "If a variable is suffixed with this "--" then it is know as post-decrement Operator."
                    Syntax :
                              "variable--"
